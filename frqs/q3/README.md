## 2024 Question 3 

## This question is about...
- Will return true if each element of wordList (except the first) contains the previous element in the substring and returns false otherwise.
- Will return an ArrayList of String based on strings from the wordList that contains target
- When target is added to the returned ArrayList, the target word will be removed from the elements before being added into the ArrayList. 

## Struggles with this question...
- Making sure that there is no out of bound error when using substring/indexOf and the loops. 

## Prior expereiences that helped...
- Uses of indexOf and substrings when working with Strings.
- Implementing String into a condition in a if statement. 

## What I learned by doing this question...
- An advance for loop would be better for this question ratehr than a normal for loop.
- Slowing being able to use substring/indexof more efficiently.
