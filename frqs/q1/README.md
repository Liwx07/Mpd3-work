## 2024 Question 1 

## This question is about...
- There are two tyeps of condition, abnormal (>5%) and normal (<5%).
- During abnormal conditions (>5%), a bear will show up to the feeder resulting in 0 food.
- During normal conditions (<5%), we randomly generated a number of food (from 10-50 grams) and substract the food times the number of birds from the current food. 

## Struggles with this question...
- The struggle I had with this question was how to apply the method in the class to another method.
- Also when using Math.random(). I wasn't sure wither it was (mas-min +1) or just (max-min). 

## Prior expereiences that helped...
- Know what Math.random() would output
- The use of for loops as well as otehr loops.

## What I learned by doing this question...
- How to use Math.random() accurately.
- In addtion, reviewed the loops.
